		<h1>Interviewing Advice</h1>

		<p>Five things to remember during your interview process:</p>

		<img src="/media/images/picture_woman.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />

		<p>1. Dress the part. Don’t give the interviewer an added reason to
			call you out for your youth. Dress professional and groom yourself
			properly. That means no crazy jewelry, no unruly hairstyles, and that
			very noticeable eyebrow piercing – you might want to take that out.
		</p>

		<p>2. Keep an open mind. Very few people start off in their dream
			position, so go in for any interview you can. At the very least,
			you’ll be getting interview experience and building your ability to
			sell yourself. At best, you’ll find that great starter job.</p>

		<p>3. Have reasonable expectations. You’re not going to making your
			dream salary right off the bat. Embrace the fact that you’ll have
			room to grow and accept offers that seems evenhanded.</p>

		<p>4. Sell your experience. You don’t have to have been an executive
			to have important work under your belt. Internships, part-time jobs
			and student activities can often be used to exemplify certain skill
			sets.</p>

		<p>5. Promote your assets. One of the biggest benefits of hiring a
			millennial is that we are essentially blank pallets. Remind your
			interviewer that your youth and freshness is more asset than
			liability. As long as you learn quickly (and I’m sure you do) they
			can shape you to fit the company how they would like. </p>
