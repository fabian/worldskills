		<h1>Skills/Compétences Canada Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p>Skills/Compétences Canada is committed to protecting the personal
			information of its employees, volunteers, members, competitors and
			other stakeholders. We value the trust of those we deal with, and of
			the public, and recognize that maintaining this trust requires that
			we be transparent and accountable in how we treat the information
			that you choose to share with us.</p>
		 
		<p>In the course of S/CC activities, the organization collects
			personal information in order to facilitate communication with
			interested parties and stakeholders. At no time does S/CC make this
			information public. Nor does S/CC ever sell this information to
			external entities. The information collected by S/CC is used strictly
			by S/CC national and provincial offices for its activities, which may
			include providing some personal information to travel agencies for
			group travel or to the Government of Canada for statistical research
			or contact from respective Ministerial offices in relation to
			congratulatory messages.</p>

		<p>Anyone from whom we collect such information should expect that it
			will be carefully protected and that any use of, or dealing with,
			this information is subject to consent. Our privacy practices are
			designed to achieve this.</p>
		<h2>Definition of Personal Information:</h2>
		<p>Personal information is any information that can be used to
			distinguish, identify or contact a specific individual. This
			information can include an individual's opinions or beliefs, as well
			as facts about, or related to, the individual. Exceptions: business
			contact information and certain publicly available information, such
			as name, addresses and telephone numbers as published in telephone
			directories, are not considered personal information.</p>

		<p>Where an individual use his or her home contact information as
			business contact information as well, we consider that the contact
			information provided is business contact information and is not,
			therefore, subject to protection as personal information.</p>

		<h2>The Ten Principles of Privacy:</h2>
		<p>
			Principle #1: Accountability
			<br />
			S/CC is accountable for all personal information in its custody,
			including any personal information disclosed to third parties for
			processing or other administrative function. S/CC has established
			policies and procedures to comply with this code and has designated
			one or more persons to be accountable for compliance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Principle #2: Identifying the Purposes of Collecting Personal
			Information
			<br />
			S/CC will identify the purposes for which it collects the personal
			information before or when the information is collected.
		</p>
		<p>
			Principle #3: Obtaining Consent
			<br />
			S/CC will make a reasonable effort to make sure that stakeholders
			understand how their personal information will be used by the
			organization. S/CC will obtain consent from its stakeholders before
			or when it collects or uses the personal information. S/CC will not
			attempt to deceive a stakeholder into providing consent.
		</p>

		<p>A stakeholder's consent can be express or given through an
			authorized representative. A stakeholder can withdraw consent at any
			time, with certain exceptions. S/CC, however, can collect, use or
			disclose personal information without the stakeholder's consent or
			knowledge in exceptional circumstances where such collection, use or
			disclosure is required by law.</p>
		<p>
			Principle #4: Limits for Collecting Personal Information
			<br />
			S/CC limits the amount and type of personal information it collects.
			S/CC will collect personal information for the purposes it identifies
			to the stakeholder. S/CC collects personal information using policies
			and procedures which are fair and lawful.
		</p>
		<p>
			Principle #5: Limits for Using, Disclosing and Keeping Personal
			Information
			<br />
			S/CC will use or disclose personal information only for the reasons
			it was collected, unless required by law.
		</p>

		<p>S/CC will retain personal information only as long as necessary for
			the identified purpose for which it was collected.</p>
		<p>
			Principle #6: Keeping Personal Information Accurate
			<br />
			S/CC will keep personal information as accurate, complete and
			current as necessary for the identified purposes for which it was
			collected.
		</p>

		<p>Stakeholders may, in writing, challenge the accuracy and
			completeness of their personal information and request that it be
			amended as appropriate.</p>
		<p>
			Principle #7: Safeguarding Personal Information
			<br />
			S/CC protects personal information with safeguards appropriate to
			the sensitivity of the information.
		</p>
		<p>
			Principle #8: Making Information Available
			<br />
			S/CC is open about the policies and procedures it uses to manage the
			personal information. Stakeholders have access to information about
			these policies and procedures. The information will be made
			available in a manner that is generally easy to understand.
		</p>
		<p>
			Principle #9: Access to One's Own Personal Information
			<br />
			When stakeholders make a request in writing, S/CC will within a
			reasonable time tell them what personal information S/CC has, what
			it is being used for and to whom it has been disclosed.
		</p>

		<p>When stakeholders request in writing, S/CC will give them access
			to their personal information. S/CC will respond to the written
			request in a timely fashion.</p>
		<p>
			Principle #10: Complaints and Questions
			<br />
			Stakeholders may challenge S/CC's compliance with this code. S/CC
			has policies and procedures to receive, investigate, and respond to
			customers' complaints and questions.
		</p>
