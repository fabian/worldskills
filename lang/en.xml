		<h1>About Skills Canada</h1>
		<h2>Who we are.</h2>
		<p>Skills/Compétences Canada is a national, not-for-profit
			organization that actively promotes careers in skilled trades and
			technologies to Canadian youth. Along with our private sector
			partners, we are helping to secure Canada’s future skilled labour
			needs.
			Since its inception in 1989, S/CC has evolved into a
			pan-Canadian
			organization offering skilled trades and technology
			competitions at
			the regional, provincial/territorial, national and
			international
			levels as well as other awareness programs for thousands
			of young
			Canadians. </p>

		<p>The mandate of S/CC is as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Provide a unique, proven, effective and efficient program to
				raise awareness of current and emerging skilled trades and
				technology careers, by bringing Canadian youth into a competitive
				spotlight; and</li>
			<li>Actively lead in developing dynamic partnerships with agencies
				and organizations involved in promoting current and emerging
				skills-based careers in trades and technology by identifying and
				using best practices.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>What we do.</h2>
		<p>A misunderstanding of the value of careers in trades and
			technologies inhibits many young Canadians from considering these
			types of career options. Through provincial/territorial, national and
			international skills competitions, S/CC helps make these occupations
			more visible for teachers, students, parents and the general public.
			The competitions also provide a competitive atmosphere where these
			careers are seen as worthy and desirable. </p>
		<h2>Why we are needed.</h2>
		<img src="/media/images/picture_woman.jpg" alt="" class="picture" />
		<p>Over the next two decades, employers in Canada will find it
			difficult to hire and retain skilled workers. We want to help
			Canada’s industries find well-trained, well-prepared young people to
			fill these positions. S/CC wants youth to understand the many
			opportunities, benefits and rewards of skilled trade and technology
			careers. Improving the expertise and confidence of individuals
			pursuing technical careers will benefit us all.</p>]]>
